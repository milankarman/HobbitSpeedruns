## Any% No Major Glitches (PC)

This guide covers the full route for the Any% No Major Glitches category on PC.
This guide mainly focuses on the current "optimal" route and doesn't include alternate routes, but it does include some backups.
All of this was recorded in one take and serves and will most likely be replaced by a better guide down the line, but I did try my best to make this as clear as possible. Maybe I tried a little bit too hard and overexplained some stuff, hence the length. But that's better than explaining too little.
